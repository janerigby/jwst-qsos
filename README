simulate_jwst_R100.py  and  simulate_wfirst_grism.py  are twopython codes that make fake spectra.

    simulate_wfirst_grism.py  Makes fake WFIRST grism spectra.  Default example is for a z=4 QSO.
    			      Adds noise, currently set to the HLS survey depth.

    simulate_jwst_R100.py     Makes fake R=100 JWST/NIRSpec spectra.  Default example is a z=8 QSO
    			      that a WFIRST photometric survey might find.  Adds noise, currently
			      set to the JWST/NIRSpec depth in 10,000s.

Call on command line as:  
     /Volumes/Apps_and_Docs/JRR_Utils/anaconda/bin/python  simulate_jwst_R100.py
     /Volumes/Apps_and_Docs/JRR_Utils/anaconda/bin/python  simulate_wfirst_grism.py 

A note about libraries:  
  As always with python, the fun in sharing code is getting the same libraries.  The main libraries
  I've used are the standard astropy, numpy, and matplotlib.  The one weirdo library I've used is
  block_reduce in skimage.measure, because it does a nice job of binning down the spectra.  


PNG Files:   Several example output spectra.  They're explained in my IAU talk,  ../JRR_IAU_talk.
